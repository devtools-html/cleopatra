  # 1. script-src
  #   a. The first hash is for the addon's content.js file being injected
  #      with WebExt's tabs.executeScript API.
  #   b. The second hash is for the addon's content-home.js being injected from
  #      the addon's manifest.json.
  #   You can generate these hashes using the website
  #   https://report-uri.io/home/hash after grabbing the script from the Inspector.
  #   NOTE: you can't use the script file directly as the API modifies it before injecting.
  #   c. We use Google Analytics to track the usage of the application.
  # 2. `unsafe-inline` in `style-src` is necessary to support favicons.
  # 3. `img-src` defines rules to specifically allow http, https, and data URLs.
  # 4. `object-src` is for plugins, we don't need them.
  # 5. `connect-src` is `*` to support `from-url`. We also do requests to bitly to shorten URLs.
  # 6. `frame-ancestors` is the same purpose as `X-Frame-Options` above.
  # 7. `form-action`prevents forms, we don't need this.`
  # 8. `frame-src` allows the embedding of YouTube videos in the docs.
