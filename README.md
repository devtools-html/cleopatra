# perf.html

[![slack-badge]][slack]

[perf.html] visualizes performance data recorded from web browsers. It is a tool designed to consume performance profiles from the Gecko Profiler but can visualize data from any profiler able to output in JSON. The interface is a web application built using [React] and [Redux] and runs entirely client-side.

[Mozilla] develops this tool to help make [Firefox] silky smooth and fast for millions of its users, and to help make sites and apps faster across the web.
