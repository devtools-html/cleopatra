# Profiler Architecture

## DevTools Recording Panel

Please note, this is the diagram for the new recording panel in DevTools that is off by default. This is the path forward for integrating [profiler.firefox.com](https://profiler.firefox.com) into DevTools. It can be enabled using `devtools.performance.new-panel-enabled`. There is no architecture doc for the current Firefox DevTools panel.

## Remote Profiling

Remote profiling with DevTools is very similar to the above diagram, but involves slightly different transport messaging mechanisms in order to target remote devices.
